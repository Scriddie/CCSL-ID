# Ideas for Improvement
1. Only apply acyclicity constraint gradually/at a later stage?
2. Do not optimize over diagonal?
3. Use dropout (predictions/gradients)?
4. **Combine continuous structure learning with cyclic relationships**

# Datasets

## SynTREn
They talk about ODE simulations. Should have a look at them.
Check out the original source networks they consider, also look for more up-to-date networks
They seem to just do additive noise models
Visualize and compare that to Sachs et al and another dataset from vowels2021
